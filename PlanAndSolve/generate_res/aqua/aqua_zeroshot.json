Let $x_1$ be the initial distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is $45^\\circ$. Let $x_2$ be the distance of the car from the base of the tower when the angle of elevation is $60^\\circ$. Let $t$ be the time it takes for the car to travel from the point where the angle of elevation is $60^\\circ$ to the base of the tower.\n\nFrom the given information, we have:\n$\\tan(45^\\circ) = \\frac{h}{x_1} \\Rightarrow x_1 = h$\n$\\tan(60^\\circ) = \\frac{h}{x_2} \\Rightarrow x_2 = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}$\n\nThe car travels a distance $x_1 - x_2$ in 10 minutes.\n$x_1 - x_2 = h - \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}} = h(1 - \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}}) = h(\\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{\\sqrt{3}})$\n\nSince the speed is uniform, let the speed be $v$. Then, $x_1 - x_2 = 10v$, and $x_2 = tv$.\nSo, $10v = h(\\frac{\\sqrt{3} - 1}{\\sqrt{3}})$ and $tv = \\frac{h}{\\sqrt{3}}$.\n\nDivide the second equation by the first equation:\n$\\frac{tv}{10v} = \\frac{h/\\sqrt{3}}{h(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}-1}{\\sqrt{3}})}$\n$\\frac{t}{10} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3} - 1} = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{3} - 1}$\n$t = \\frac{10}{\\sqrt{3} - 1} = \\frac{10(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{(\\sqrt{3} - 1)(\\sqrt{3} + 1)} = \\frac{10(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{3 - 1} = \\frac{10(\\sqrt{3} + 1)}{2} = 5(\\sqrt{3} + 1)$\n\nTherefore, the time it will take for the car to reach the base of the tower is $5(\\sqrt{3} + 1)$ minutes.",

The customer paid $1.90 more than half the original price, so the price is 0.5x + 1.90.\n5.  Set up the equation: 0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90.\n6.  Solve for x.\n\nSolution:\n1. Let x be the original price.\n2. Discounted price: 0.78x\n3. Price after coupon: 0.78x - 20\n4. Given information: 0.78x - 20 = 0.5x + 1.90\n5.

    "plan-and-solve": "Here's my plan to solve this probability problem:\n\n1.  **Define Events:** Let A be the event that Stock A increases in value, and B be the event that Stock B increases in value. We are given P(A) = 0.56 and P(B) = 0.74.\n\n2.  **Target Probability:** We want to find the greatest possible value for the probability that *neither* stock increases in value. This is represented as P(A' and B'), where A' and B' are the complements of A and B, respectively.  Using DeMorgan's Law, P(A' and B') = P((A or B)').  Therefore, we want to find the greatest value of 1 - P(A or B).\n\n3.  **Maximize P(A or B):**  To minimize 1 - P(A or B), we need to maximize P(A or B).  The formula for P(A or B) is P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B).  To maximize P(A or B), we need to maximize P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Since P(A) and P(B) are fixed, we need to minimize P(A and B).\n\n4.  **Minimize P(A and B):** The minimum value of P(A and B) occurs when the overlap between A and B is as small as possible.  Since probabilities cannot be negative, P(A and B) must be greater than or equal to 0. The smallest value P(A and B) can take occurs when one event is contained within the other as much as possible. The minimum overlap occurs when we maximize the union of A and B. The maximum probability of A or B is 1.  So we want P(A or B) = 1.\n    P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). 1 = 0.56 + 0.74 - P(A and B).  P(A and B) = 0.56 + 0.74 - 1 = 1.30 - 1 = 0.30.\n\n5.  **Calculate P(A' and B'):** Now, we calculate the probability that neither event occurs. P(A' and B') = 1 - P(A or B) = 1 - (P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)).  Since we want to maximize P(A' and B'), we need to minimize P(A or B). Since P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B), P(A or B) will be minimized when P(A and B) is maximized. The maximum value of P(A and B) is the minimum of P(A) and P(B), which is min(0.56, 0.74) = 0.56.  Therefore, the minimum of P(A or B) is 0.56 + 0.74 - 0.56 = 0.74. So the maximum of P(A' and B') is 1 - 0.74 = 0.26.\n\nSolve:\n\n1.  **DeMorgan's Law:** P(A' and B') = 1 - P(A or B)\n\n2.  **P(A or B) Formula:** P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B) = 0.56 + 0.74 - P(A and B) = 1.3 - P(A and B)\n\n3.  **Minimize P(A or B) to maximize P(A' and B'):** We want to minimize P(A or B). This occurs when P(A and B) is maximized.  The maximum value of P(A and B) is the smaller of P(A) and P(B), which is min(0.56, 0.74) = 0.56.\n\n4.  **Calculate minimized P(A or B):** P(A or B) = 1.3 - 0.56 = 0.74\n\n5.  **Calculate maximized P(A' and B'):** P(A' and B') = 1 - P(A or B) = 1 - 0.74 = 0.26",

Calculate the time it takes to produce 10 yo-yos at the combined rate.\n\nSolution:\n1.  Machine A produces 1 yo-yo every 6 minutes, so its rate is 1/6 yo-yos per minute.\n2.  Machine B produces 1 yo-yo every 9 minutes, so its rate is 1/9 yo-yos per minute.\n3.  The combined rate is (1/6) + (1/9) yo-yos per minute.  To add these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 18.  So, (1/6) + (1/9) = (3/18) + (2/18) = 5/18 yo-yos per minute.\n4.  Let t be the time in minutes to produce 10 yo-yos. We have the equation (5/18) * t = 10.\n5.  To solve for t, multiply both sides of the equation by 18/5: t = 10 * (18/5) = (10/5) * 18 = 2 * 18 = 36 minutes.",
